# Project-3-Student-Management-System
This project uses a main class and two other classes including the Student and Course class to run a student management system(SMS) program that displays allows a user to manage a set amount of students. The student management system can add a student to the system, deactivate a student, display all the students included, search for students by an ID that they are randomly assigned, assign a job to a student, and display students with on-campus jobs. The sytem can also be exited and switched into the course management system. The course management system(CMS) allows the user to add a new course into the program, assign the course to a student by their ID, and display all the students with the assigned course. The user may also exit either and both systems when finished. For the input of a student in the SMS , the user should input a name such as "John" for first name, "Smith" for last name, and pick between "Freshman", "Sophomore", "Junior", and "Senior".
